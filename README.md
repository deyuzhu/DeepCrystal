# DeepCrystal: A Deep Learning Framework for sequence-based Protein Crystallization Prediction

Motivation: Protein structure determination has primarily been performed using X-ray crystallography. To overcome the expensive cost, high attrition rate and series of trial-and-error settings, many in-silico methods have been developed to predict crystallization propensities of proteins based on their sequences. However, majority of these methods build their predictors by extracting features from protein sequences which is computationally expensive and can explode the feature space.
